# Benchmarking Local LLMs: How We Built FLPerformance for Microsoft Foundry Local

**TL;DR**: FLPerformance is an open-source benchmarking tool that makes it straightforward to compare LLM performance on your local hardware using Microsoft Foundry Local. Get real metrics (TPS, latency, TTFT) with clear visualisations, and no cloud API costs required.

---

## The Problem: "Which Model Should I Actually Use?"

As developers integrating LLMs into applications, we have all been there: you download a few models, run some basic prompts, and then what? Which model is actually faster on *your* hardware? How does a 0.5B model compare to a 3B model for your specific use case? Is the extra RAM worth it?

Without proper benchmarking, you are flying blind. You might choose a model that is three times slower than necessary, or waste hours tuning prompts only to discover the model cannot handle your load.

**We needed answers. So I built FLPerformance.**

## What is FLPerformance?

## Your First Benchmark

### 1. Load a Model

Navigate to the **Models** tab:
- Click "Add Model"
- Select from Foundry Local catalog (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder-0.5b`)
- Click "Load" (first time downloads the model)
- Status turns green when ready

**Pro tip**: Click the "Test" button to verify the model responds before benchmarking.

### 2. Configure Your Benchmark

Go to **Benchmarks** tab:

```javascript
{
  "iterations": 5,          // Run each scenario 5 times
  "concurrency": 1,         // Sequential requests
  "timeout": 60000,         // 60 second timeout
  "streaming": true,        // Measure time-to-first-token
  "scenarios": [
    "Simple Q&A - Short",
    "Code Generation",
    "Summarization"
  ]
}
```

Select your loaded model(s) and hit "Run Benchmark".

### 3. Analyse Results

The **Results** tab shows:

**Performance Score (0-100)**: Weighted combination of throughput, latency, and reliability
```
Score = (TPS/100)*40 + (40 - P95/100)*40 + (100 - ErrorRate)*20
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **TPS (Tokens/Second)**: Raw throughput - higher is better
- **TTFT (Time to First Token)**: Responsiveness - lower is better
- **P95 Latency**: 95% of responses faster than this
- **Error Rate**: Reliability indicator

**Visual Comparisons**:
- Bar charts comparing TPS and latency across models
- Radar chart showing multidimensional performance
- "Best for..." cards highlighting optimal use cases

| Model | Size | TPS | P95 Latency | Error Rate | Score |
|-------|------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|
| qwen2.5-coder-0.5b | 528 MB | 7.61 | 920ms | 0% | 63/100 |
| phi-4 | 8.5 GB | 0.24 | 29,181ms | 0% | 30/100 |
| qwen2.5-7b | 7 GB | - | - | 100% | Failed to load |

**Key Insights**:

1. **Hardware Matters**: The phi-4 model (8.5GB) exceeded available VRAM (2GB), causing massive slowdowns as it swapped to system RAM. Time to first token: **15 seconds**!

2. **31x Performance Gap**: qwen2.5-coder-0.5b delivered 7.61 TPS vs phi-4's 0.24 TPS - purely due to model size vs available VRAM.

3. **Model Loading Limits**: qwen2.5-7b failed completely due to insufficient resources, highlighting the importance of testing on target hardware.

**Without benchmarking**, we might have deployed phi-4 thinking "bigger is better", resulting in 30-second wait times for users. FLPerformance revealed the hardware mismatch immediately, saving us from shipping unusable performance.

**Lesson**: Always benchmark on hardware that matches your deployment target. A model that works fine on a desktop GPU might be unusable on integrated graphics.

## Under the Hood: The Model Identifier Fix

During development, we hit a critical bug: **100% error rate on all benchmarks**. Models would load successfully, but every inference request failed with cryptic `400` errors.

### The Investigation

```javascript
// What we were doing (WRONG)
const modelName = modelInfo.alias;  // "qwen2.5-coder-0.5b"
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: modelName,  // ❌ Fails!
  messages: [...]
});
```

Foundry Local's OpenAI-compatible endpoint requires the **full model identifier**, not the alias:

```javascript
// The fix (CORRECT)
const modelName = modelInfo.id;  // "qwen2.5-coder-0.5b-instruct-cuda-gpu:4"
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: modelName,  // ✅ Works!
  messages: [...]
});
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Test endpoints separately**: We added a "Test" button that validates model inference before running full benchmarks
2. **Better error logging**: The system now captures status codes, response bodies, and full stack traces
3. **Fail fast**: Validate model health before starting expensive benchmark runs

This fix took benchmarks from **100% failure to 0% error rate**.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Benchmark Suites

Create your own test scenarios:

```json
// benchmarks/suites/my-suite.json
{
  "name": "code-completion",
  "description": "Code completion scenarios",
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "name": "Python Function",
      "prompt": "Write a Python function that calculates fibonacci numbers",
      "max_tokens": 200,
      "expected_output_length": "medium"
    },
    {
      "name": "React Component",
      "prompt": "Create a React component for a user profile card",
      "max_tokens": 300,
      "expected_output_length": "long"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Programmatic Access

The REST API makes automation easy:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Run benchmark
const { data } = await axios.post('http://localhost:3001/api/benchmarks/run', {
  modelIds: ['model_123'],
  suiteName: 'code-completion',
  config: { iterations: 10, streaming: true }
});

// Poll for completion
const runId = data.runId;
let status = 'running';
while (status === 'running') {
  const res = await axios.get(`/api/benchmarks/runs/${runId}/status`);
  status = res.data.status;
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));
}

// Export results
const results = await axios.get(`/api/benchmarks/runs/${runId}/export/json`);
```

### CI/CD Integration

Run benchmarks as part of your pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/benchmark.yml
name: Model Performance Tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: self-hosted  # Your GPU runner
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Benchmarks
        run: |
          npm run server &
          node scripts/run-benchmark.js
      - name: Upload Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: benchmark-results
          path: results/*.json
```

Track performance regressions over time!

## Performance Optimization Tips

From our benchmarking experience:

1. **Start Small**: Test with one iteration and one scenario first. Scale up once you verify everything works.

2. **Streaming Matters**: Enable streaming to measure TTFT. This reveals models that are slow to start but fast once generating.

3. **Temperature Tuning**: Lower temperature (0.3 to 0.5) is faster and more consistent for benchmarking.

4. **Batch Your Tests**: Run all models in one benchmark run for a fair comparison (same system state).

5. **Watch Resources**: Monitor GPU memory. Loading too many models simultaneously causes thrashing.

6. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: The first inference on a GPU takes longer owing to initialisation. Set the timeout to 60 seconds, not 30.

## What We Learned Building This

### The Good

- **Foundry Local SDK** is excellent: clean API, good documentation, reliable model loading
- **OpenAI compatibility** means existing tools and libraries just work
- **Local execution** makes iteration fast (no API latency or costs)

### The Challenges

- **Model Identifier Confusion**: Alias versus ID versus Foundry ID took time to untangle
- **Resource Monitoring**: Cross-platform GPU metrics are tricky (macOS especially)
- **First Inference Latency**: GPU warmup can take 30 to 60 seconds and needs proper handling

### Design Decisions

**Why JSON Storage by Default?**  
SQLite requires native compilation (build tools). JSON files work everywhere immediately. You can enable SQLite later if needed.

**Why Polling Instead of WebSockets?**  
Simpler to implement, works with any deployment setup, and is perfectly adequate for a local development tool. WebSockets would be over-engineering for this purpose.

**Why Sequential Benchmarking?**  
Concurrent benchmarks contaminate one another's metrics through resource contention. Sequential execution gives accurate per-model measurements.

## Future Roadmap

Ideas we are exploring:

- **Historical Trends**: Track performance over time and detect regressions
- **Automated Tuning**: Find optimal temperature and token settings for your use case
- **Distributed Benchmarking**: Run tests across multiple machines
- **Model Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on your requirements
- **Cost Analysis**: Compare local execution costs against cloud API costs for your workload

## Conclusion

Benchmarking does not have to be painful. With FLPerformance and Foundry Local, you can:

- Compare models objectively on your hardware
- Make data-driven decisions about model selection
- Avoid costly mistakes in production
- Optimise for your specific use case

**Stop guessing. Start measuring.**

The difference between a 50 ms response and a 5000 ms response is the difference between a snappy application and a frustrated user. FLPerformance helps you ship the former.
